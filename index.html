        <h3>What is Splace?
          <p>Splace is a combination of the word safe and place. We wanted to provide a comfortable setting for users to release anxiety digitally without the need of paper.</p>

  <div class ="QuestionCon">
          <h3>Can't you just write in a notebook?
              <p>The overconsumption of paper causes 14% of deforestations. Although the number seems minimal, 14% is very large in the perspective of deforestation. Our goal at Splace is to reduce paper consumption by creating personalized/customized E-Journals.</p>

  <div class ="QuestionCon">
          <h3>Why is Splace so great?
              <p>Instead of physical journals that people can often intrude, Splace will be secured with a login. We also want as much customization as possible to make it personal.</p>
